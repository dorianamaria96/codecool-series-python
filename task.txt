Create a page with a dropdown list containing all the different show titles that have more than 5 related genres. List them in chronological order.
There should be an option at the top saying "-- Not selected --".
When you change the selection of this dropdown, you should see the detailed information of the selected show, displaying the following data:
- production year
- 25th anniversary (highlight it if that year is in the past)
- number of seasons (do NOT count specials)
- rounded up rating represented as an asterisk (*) characters (e.g. the value 3.7 will show 4 asterisks: **)
The page must NOT be reloaded during the search.
If the "-- Not selected --" option is selected, it should clear all the data.
